## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to design and implement a solution to the [Travelling Salesman Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem) using the Ant Swarm Optimization algorithm.

This repo contains a jupyter notebook file showing the complete implementation and runs.

In addition to the implementation, each design choice is explained and well documented in the context of the problem.

Thanks,
